# Introduction to Exploiting Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

This is a companion repository for the [CPOSC](https://www.cposc.org) 2023
presentation "Introduction to Exploiting Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities".

## I am at CPOSC and want to follow along!

First, use the button above to open a copy of the presentation so that you can
see what to type during the demos.

Then see [Using devcontainers](#using-devcontainers) for the two methods you can
use. But if you are at CPOSC, *I highly suggest* you use [Github
Codespaces](#github-codespaces).  [Local VS
Code](#local-vs-code-and-devcontainers) might work, but you could need to
download ~500 MiB of containers, and who knows how well that will work if
everyone is trying to do that on CPOSC's wifi?

## Using devcontainers

You have two options for using devcontainers.

### Local VS Code and devcontainers

[![Open in Dev
Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/edmcman/cposc-exploit)

If you have VS code installed and configured to use devcontainers (i.e., you
have docker installed), you can click the button above to set up a
devcontainer to follow along in.

### Github Codespaces

You can also run the devcontainer in a Github Code Space.  All you need is a
Github account and a web browser.  Click the above button to create a code
space.
